## General Introduction

Nowadays, a large amount of data in the form of text is available. Examples include social media chats, blogs, emails, customer reviews, articles, etc. Researches work on the development of automatic text data classification techniques that could perform sentiment analysis, topic labeling, structuring, intent detection, and other tasks in a fast and cost-effective way. Such procedures are of great interest to the government and private companies as they allow them to extract valuable insights from text data and help in decision making (MonkeyLearn, n.d.). 

Deep learning algorithms have shown good results in automatic text summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, translation, and other  processes (Alayba, Palade, England, & Iqbal, 2018; Wang, Jiang, & Luo, 2016). Among the most common deep neural network models used for text classification are convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). CNN allow to extract needful features from an input text through convolutional and pooling layers: convolution layers apply filters over input signals while pooling layers subsample obtained matrixes. RNN are characterized by loops that act as the "network memory” enabling to learn and generalize across input data sequences (Nigam, 2018).


(will post the text here soon)









(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(You should begin by introducing your topic. In this section, you should define the core terminology specific to the field, introduce the problem statement, and make clear the benefits (motivate!) of resolving that problem statement. The main difference between the ABSTRACT and Introduction sections is that the abstract summarizes the entire project, including results, whereas the introduc-tion only provides the motivation of the problem and an overview of the proposed solution.)

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

(This project makes the following contributions:)(you must have this!!)
•	(Contribution 1)
•	(Contribution 2)


## The Model

(Provide structural and behavior diagrams of the system you wish to study.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?) (Use the model to tell us what is going on.)

(explicitly list your requirements of what the model will have and simulate for the proposal)

## Fundamental Questions
(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions) (Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )

## Expected Results
(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?) (This changes from Expected (Proposal) to just Results (final report)) (you should verbally define them) (sketch a few graphs of what you are roughly going for - not the data but histogram of this, line graph of that, screenshot of an agent - use paper and pencil sketches)

## Research Methods
(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Discrete Event Continuous Modeling...)(Python or Anylogic) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards) (Steps in the process)

## Dataset
(mention datasets you are going to use) 

## Code

## Discussion
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (What would you have done differently) (What are the contributions summerize)(what is the big take away)(what did you learn)

## Future Work
(final only - remove whole section for proposal Readme) (if you had 6 more months what would be the next steps in this project.) (What are a few questions you have now)
